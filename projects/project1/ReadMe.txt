Sisyphus
	
Sisyphus is a Greek king that was sentenced to an eternal punishment where he must push a huge boulder to the top pf a mountain where he will never reach. That a cruel punishment, exactly how it must be for the sins you have done, hahaha.
My game is a recreation of the Sisyphus, myth using jQuery and jQuery UI JavaScript library. Combining it with a little of html and CSS coding I created this cruel game where you must slide a slider till the end. Good luck! As you will notice, it’s impossible to reach the end because you will get a dialogue box saying you lose and a chance to try again. You can’t win this game, just like syphilis couldn’t pull the boulder all the way to the top of the mountain.
The challenge to create this game was learning jQuery. I’ve learned the basics of the library, but I needed more knowledge to create this impossible game. With the help of the amazing, extensive API documentation, and with the help of my amazing teacher and TA, I was able to finish building the game. 
In the future, I would like to learn more ways to extend the game experience to a new level by learning new libraries for game creation. There are many libraries such as Phaser which is a great way to start building better games.
